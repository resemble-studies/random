# Ensemble Random

A uniform distributed random number generator.

 - Supports assigning seeds.
 - Range of random values.
 - Simple to use.

## Usage

We include the `Random` class.

```c++
#include <ensemble/random.hpp>
using Ensemble::Random;
```

We create an instance of `Random`.

```c++
auto random = Random();
```

We initialise our `Random` instance by calling the `Randomize` which fills the seed with values based on the system clock.

```c++
random.Randomize();
```

We might as well obtain the seed generated by the `Randomize` method.

```c++
auto initialSeed = random.GetSeed();
```

We can use the `GetRand()` method (with a maximum value) to get an integer value.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
    printf("%d\n", random.GetRand(1000));
}
```
... output:
```
760
435
954
372
237
149
114
676
113
888
```

We can use the `GetRandF()` method (with a maximum value) to get a float value.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
    printf("%f\n", random.GetRandF(1000));
}
```
... output:
```
41.0
518.0
370.0
636.0
104.0
530.0
531.0
239.0
312.0
695.0
```

We could also initialise the `Random` class with our initial seed.

```c++
random = Random(initialSeed);
```

The output will be the same if we repeated the processes from the above loops since we are using the same seed.
